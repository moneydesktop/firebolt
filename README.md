# Firebolt

Firebolt is a simple cache warmer. It warms the cache using a specially defined warmer class.

It's not quite ready for Prime Timeâ„¢ and needs specs (YIKES!). Feel free add some, if you like...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'firebolt'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install firebolt

## Usage

To use Firebolt, you first need to configure it.

#### Configure & Initialize!

```Ruby
::Firebolt.configure do |config|
  # Required
  config.cache = ::Rails.cache # Or anything that adheres to Rails's cache interface
  config.warming_frequency = 12.hours # In seconds. Get minutes/hours/days helper w/ ActiveSupport
  config.warmer = ::YourAwesomeCacheWarmer
end
```

Then you need to initialize it:

```Ruby
# Calling initialize! starts the warming cycle.
# It's best to skip the warming cycle while running specs. Warming is
# automatically skipped while running specs in Rails apps. In other apps, set
# FIREBOLT_SKIP_WARMING to true (or 1, or 'sandwich').
::Firebolt.initialize!

# Also takes a block so you can initialize and configure at the same time:
::Firebolt.initialize! do |config|
  config.cache = ::Rails.cache
  config.warming_frequency = 12.hours
  config.warmer = ::YourAwesomeCacheWarmer
end
```

#### Reading cached data

Firebolt provides two methods for retrieving cached data: `Firebolt.read` & `Firebolt.fetch`.

`Firebolt.read` takes your cache key and return the value from the cache.

`Firebolt.fetch` does the same thing, but also takes an optional block that is called when there is a cache miss.

#### Warming the cache

Firebolt uses a cache warmer that you create. Valid cache warmers must:

1. Include `Firebolt::Warmer`
2. Define a `perform` method that returns a hash

Here's an example:

```Ruby
class YourAwesomeCacheWarmer
  include ::Firebolt::Warmer

  def perform
    # Returns a hash. The keys become the cache keys and the values become cache values.
  end
end
```

Firebolt uses this warmer to re-warm the cache at the frequency you configure (e.g. `config.warming_frequency`). If it's set to re-warm every 12 hours, Firebolt will warm the cache every twelve hours.

Under the hood, Firebolt keeps track of the current cache set. That way, it's able to warm a new cache set and swap it with the old cache set in place, avoiding cache misses.
